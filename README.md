# Experience Enablers Website & CMS

A website with integrated Content Management System for Experience Enablers.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start in development mode
node app.js

# Or with nodemon for auto-restart
nodemon app.js
```

### Current Prototype Deployment (Render)
The prototype version is currently deployed on Render's free tier:

1. **GitHub Setup**
   - Company GitHub account hosts the repository
   - Connected to Render for automated deployments

2. **Render Configuration**
   ```
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: node app.js
   Environment Variables:
     - NODE_ENV=production
     - SESSION_SECRET=[secure random string]
   ```

3. **Limitations**
   - Free tier has limited uptime (750 hours/month)
   - Instances spin down after inactivity periods
   - Uploaded files aren't persistent across deployments
   - Using Render subdomain instead of custom domain

### Planned Production Deployment (Digital Ocean)
The final production environment will use a Digital Ocean Droplet:

1. **Server Specifications**
   - Basic Droplet: 1 GB RAM / 1 CPU
   - 25 GB SSD Disk
   - 1000 GB transfer
   - $6 USD/month plan
   - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   export NODE_ENV=production
   export PORT=3000  # Or your preferred port
   export SESSION_SECRET=your-strong-secret
   ```

3. **Process Management with PM2**
   ```bash
   # Install PM2 globally
   npm install -g pm2
   
   # Start application with PM2
   pm2 start app.js --name "experience-enablers"
   
   # Configure PM2 to start on system boot
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

4. **Reverse Proxy Setup (Nginx)**
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

5. **SSL Configuration with Let's Encrypt**
   ```bash
   # Install Certbot
   apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   
   # Obtain and configure SSL certificate
   certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
   ```

### Formspree Contact Form Configuration
- **Current Setup**: Using developer email for testing to preserve company's free quota
- **Production Setup**: Will be updated to use michelle@experienceenablers.com
- Form endpoint will need to be updated in contact.ejs before final deployment

## üíæ Database and Backups

### Database Structure
The SQLite database (`data/cms.db`) includes these key tables:
- `admin` - Admin user credentials
- `galleries` - Gallery collections metadata
- `gallery_images` - Individual gallery images
- `blog_posts` - Blog content and metadata
- `blog_tags` - Blog categorization tags
- `post_tags` - Relationship mapping between posts and tags

### Backup Procedures
Regular backups are essential:

```bash
# Create backups directory
mkdir -p backups

# Database backup
cp data/cms.db backups/cms-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Uploaded files backup
tar -czf backups/uploads-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz public/uploads/
```

### Restore Process
```bash
# Restore database
cp backups/cms-YYYYMMDD.db data/cms.db

# Restore uploads
tar -xzf backups/uploads-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz -C /path/to/site/public/
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Admin Account
- Change the default password immediately after installation
- Store recovery codes securely in a password manager
- Periodically update admin password

### Server Security
- Always use HTTPS in production (via Nginx + Let's Encrypt)
- Keep Node.js and npm packages updated
- Apply security headers via Nginx configuration
- Enable firewall rules limiting access to necessary ports

### Content Security
- Verify that uploaded images don't contain malicious content
- Be cautious with embedded content in blog posts
- Regularly review and update plugins and dependencies

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Maintenance
1. **System Updates**
   ```bash
   # Update application code
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   
   # Restart application
   pm2 restart experience-enablers
   ```

2. **Database Maintenance**
   - Run periodic backups (daily/weekly)
   - Check database size and performance
   - Consider cleaning up old/unused images

3. **Content Audit**
   - Review and update outdated content
   - Check for broken links or missing images
   - Update team information as needed

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check application status
pm2 status

# View application logs
pm2 logs experience-enablers

# Monitor server resources
htop
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Problems**
   - Clear browser cookies
   - Try password recovery with recovery codes
   - Check database connectivity

2. **Upload Issues**
   - Verify proper permissions on uploads directory
   - Check file size limits (configured to 50MB max)
   - Ensure supported file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF)

3. **Database Errors**
   - Check if database file exists and is not corrupted
   - Verify database is not locked by another process
   - Restore from backup if necessary

4. **Server Connectivity**
   - Confirm server is running (`pm2 status`)
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify domain DNS configuration
